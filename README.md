# holbertonschool-simple_shell
This project is a team collaboration for the end of the quarter at Holberton School. The goal of this project is to create a basic command-line interpreter, also known as a Shell, that provides users with an interface to interact with the operating system. This README provides an overview of the project and how to use the Simple Shell.

## Introduction

The Simple Shell project is an implementation of a basic command-line interpreter written in C. It allows users to enter commands and execute them, providing access to various operating system services.


## Getting Started

To get started with the Simple Shell, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Compile the source code using [compiler command].
- Run the compiled executable.
- You should now see the shell prompt, where you can enter commands.


## Usage

The Simple Shell supports various functions and system calls, including: 
access (man 2 access) 
chdir (man 2 chdir) 
close (man 2 close) 
closedir (man 3 closedir) 
execve (man 2 execve) 
exit (man 3 exit) 
_exit (man 2 _exit) 
fflush (man 3 fflush) 
fork (man 2 fork) 
free (man 3 free) 
getcwd (man 3 getcwd) 
getline (man 3 getline) 
getpid (man 2 getpid) 
isatty (man 3 isatty) 
kill (man 2 kill) 
malloc (man 3 malloc) 
open (man 2 open) 
opendir (man 3 opendir) 
perror (man 3 perror) 
printf (man 3 printf) 
fprintf (man 3 fprintf) 
vfprintf (man 3 vfprintf) 
sprintf (man 3 sprintf) 
putchar (man 3 putchar) 
read (man 2 read) 
readdir (man 3 readdir) 
signal (man 2 signal) 
stat (__xstat) 
(man 2 stat) 
lstat (__lxstat) 
(man 2 lstat) 
fstat (__fxstat) 
(man 2 fstat) 
strtok (man 3 strtok) 
wait (man 2 wait) 
waitpid (man 2 waitpid) 
wait3 (man 2 wait3) 
wait4 (man 2 wait4) 
write (man 2 write)

To execute a command, simply type it into the shell prompt and press Enter. The shell will then process the command and provide the appropriate output.
